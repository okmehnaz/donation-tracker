User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

Admin: An admin can add and remove users and locations as well as unlock/lock accounts.
User: A user is anyone who wants to use the system to view inventory or locations. They cannot actually alter any information.
Location Employee: A location employee is someone who works at one of the dropoff sites and can update the current inventories for his or her location.
Manager: Someone who can view/add/modify information at all locations.
All user types contain the same basic information:
•login name (in recognition of current popular trends, this can be the email address)
•password
•account state (locked or unlocked)
•contact info (email address)
•In addition to this information, a Location Employee should be linked to their location(Employees should only be able to edit information for their specific location).
